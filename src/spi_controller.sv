Timings from APS6404L-3SQR datasheet (PSRAM chip on QQSPI PSRAM Pmod)

Data is read on the rising edge of CLK.

Clock period is min 30.3ns for READ (tCLK)
Clock high and low width must be between 0.45 and 0.55 of tCLK (tCH and tCL)
Clock transition time is max 1.5ns (tKHKL)

CE# must be held low min 2.5ns before first CLK rise (tCSP)
CE# must be held high min 3.0ns after last CLK rise (tCHD)
CE# must not be held low for more than 8Âµs (tCEM)
CE# must be held high for min. 18ns between bursts (tCPH)
MISO transitions to high-z max 5.5ns after CE# goes high (tHZ)

Data is latched in rising CLK edge
Setup time for data in is 2 ns before CLK rise (tSP)
Hold time for data in is 2 ns after CLK rise (tHD)

Data is latched out on falling CLK edge
Output delay is 2 - 5.5ns after CLK fall (tACLK)
Data is held after CLK fall for at min. 1.5ns (tKOH)

Write is terminated by pulling CE# high min 3.0ns after last rising CLK (tCHD)
while keeping data valid for 2ns (tHD)
Read is terminated by pulling CE# high min 3.0ns after last rising CLK (tCHD),
but data will not be valid until 2-5.5ns after the last fallign CLK (tACLK) and
data will be invalidated within at most 5.5ns after CE# goes high.

Design is running at 48MHz and SPI clock will be run at 24MHz.

That makes tCLK 41.67ns, tCH 20.8ns and tCL 20.8ns.
Maximum slew for sky130A is 1.5ns, tKHKL is within bounds.

CE# is held low 20.8ns before CLK goes high, which is within bounds of 2.5ns (tCSP)
Data is latched out 20.8ns before CLK goes high, which is within bounds of 2ns (tSP)
